# Trees
##
I executed them directly on eclipse.If we copy the code directly to eclipse it would be easy or we can use these commands to check in the command prompt.The Bst folder contains bst.java in src which we have to execute.We have download the file and open command promt in that location and press dir.
###
The first command is javac -d . Bst.java.Then a new class gets created.
The second command is java classname.filename(mostly java bsttrees.Bst) where is bsttrees is the class created.
